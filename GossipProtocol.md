As the term "Gossip Protocol" suggests, the working of it is based on how an actual gossip aaround a social circle work. It is also known as Epidemic Protocol based on how an epidemic spreads in an environment. 
So, it is a communication protocol and is used widely in distributed systems.
Understanding the analogy, the protocol spreads a message amongst the nodes within the network as such as a rumour spreads or an epidemic disease spreads. 
This is one of the reason behind this protocol but there are other factors as well which play an important role in answering the "WHY" factor of this protocol such as:
1. Failure Detection
2. Scalability
3. Fault Tolerance
4. Robust
5. Consistency
6. Decentralised
   and many more... 
   
Let us first understand how gossip protocol disseminates information from one node to another.
