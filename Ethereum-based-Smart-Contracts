This post consists of all information that I know about the subject and what I understand. 

The Flow that I will be following is :
What is Ethereum?
Why have we come up with the thought of Ethereum?
What are Accounts?
Different types of Ethereum Accounts
What are Smart Contracts?
Why do we need to have Smart Contracts?
What is EVM(Ethereum Virtual Machine)
What is gas, soldidity, ether, token and many more


Ethereum is an open-source, public blockchain platform introducing for the very first time, to the concept of "Smart Contracts". The white paper is written by Vitalik Buterin.
It was thought that why should blockchain be used only for financial transactions. So the practical usage of the blockchain applications has been increased.
The platform allows decentralised apps to be built on it with the help of these Contracts. Smart Contracts basically provide an if-not-this-else-that kind of situations to find a solution to a problem. 
The piece of code written in Solidity (there are other languages as well) helps in writing the smart contract for Ethereum based platform.
Ethereum comes under blockchain 2.0 which is 2 nd generation of blockchain. This was the beginning of the era of Smart Contracts. 
ps: bitcoins belonging to the 1st generation of blockchain (blockchain 1.0)

So in gist, ethereum is much more than just a cryptocurrency, but turing complete - i.e. it can solve any computational problem given time and energy

Every cryptocurrency and blockchain platform has an account through which one can send/receive ethers. So, Accounts can be thought of simply as private key/address pairs. 
There are two types of ethereum accounts:
externally owned : owned by people or organisations.
                   controlled by private keys
contract accounts: autonomous in nature. 
                   controlled by code. (smart contracts) - triggered due to other external accounts or other smart contracts.

Users are able to create Smart Contracts by deploying their code (written in Solidity/Viper etc) in the blockchain. 
Also smart contracts are immutable pieces of code. Once deployed on the blockchain and run, they act as self operating computer programs, which automatically executes when specific conditions are met. 

These contracts are written in contract specific language called solidity, vyper. We would be talking about solidity. 
We needed to have a specific contract oriented language and not already existing ones such as C because the aim is to implement smart contracts on the EVM(Ethereum Virtual Machine) for further execution of the code.
So adding any mainstream language might not add value to it. Other than that it costs money for executing instructions so a mainstream language may cost a lot so a specific language focussing on only smart contract will make sure to use only those instructions which can cost less.
Other than that,there are security requirements as these codes are once deployed, can't be changed again.

for development of smart contracts, online browser based IDE "remix" will be useful as it has an integrating  debugging and testing environment. A new line of code added in the IDE gets compiled automatically. We can specify the compiler versions as well.. 
We have an environment that we can set, amount of ethers, account address, gas limit to be mentioned and the value in weis. 

EVM: turing complete software, runs on Ethereum network. enables anyone to run the program irrespective of the programming language.
Basically contracts written in contract specific programming language are compiled into bytecode, which can be read and executed by the EVM. 

Working:
A user requests 2 ethers from the sender. the sender initiates a transaction message code and must pay for each step of the program that they activated including the computations and the memory storage. 
this fee is paid in ethers, which is taken from the wallet of the sender. 
the transaction fee is collected by the nodes in the network that runs the evm.
Each and every node of the network  runs the EVM to execute the same instructions. this is how blockchain is maintained and updated with the many nodes connected in the network. These nodes are the miner nodes that execute and verify the transactions that update the state of the accounts in the ethereum blockchain. they are rewarded with ethers for succesful mining.
Once done, the user received 2 ethers in his wallet. 

if EVM is running the application, then whats preventing the piece of code from running  forever and not overloading the network.?
ethereum gas is the execution fee that the sender pays for running a program on the EVM. it acts as a crypto fuel driving the execution in the smart contract.
every contract has to follow a gas limit which is the maximum amount of gas that can be consumed.
ethgasstation in google. click on the first link. 

gas price is specified at the start of initiating a transaction. 
if the program requires more gas than the amount specified, the program may get reverted and also the gas will be lost. 

Deploying smart contracts:



everything is visible.

Dapps -> set of smart contracts that operate on the data stored in those contracts.
dapp has to fulfil the following conditions:
1. opensource
2. decentralised
3. tokens fueling for itself
4. generates token
5. inbuilt consensus mechanism

These dapps(decentralised application) enable direct interaction between users and providers
these are comprised of various organisations that work together to create an application.
these organisations are decentralised autonomous organisations (dao). very similar to a normal company where there is a third party and rules are not enforced digitally
but DAOs make their decisions electronically through the codes written in the smart contract or through the vote of the members. 

people add funds to the DAO and are given tokens to represent their percentage of assets.
more investment more tokens one would hold
when DAO begins to operate, members propose how to spend the funds and based on votes the proposal status is decided. hence no third party is there to be dependant on. 
examples: WEIfund,4G capital, storj.io, kyc-chain.



Now, being immutable, it is important to take care of the security of the smart contracts as once the contract is deployed, nothing can be changed. 
Following are the points that should be taken into consideration:
1. is the data public? 
   - setting up the visibility of the state variables
   		There are four visibilities of state variables : 
   		public(accessible within the contracts, derived contracts,external parties, an automatic getter is generated so publically accessible), 
   		internal(visibility within the contracts and also the derived ones, no getters are generated for external accessibility), 
   		private(visible exclusively in the contract and not in derived contracts), 
   		external


Note: private and internal prevents other contracts from accessing and modifying the state variable but is still visible outside the blockchain
The values in Ethereum state tree are stored in bytes32-hex values which are 64 characters long, corresponding to 32 bytes of storage

Lets deal with the smartness of the contracts:
Does your smart contract and the parameters behave as expected??
-> A smart contract consists of code which should be having certain conditions to be fulfilled 
and those conditions need to be followed in a proper order. It should be checked if any condition is getting followed wihout the previous condition being properly followed. 

For example, balance should be deducted only when the previous condition is met. and when the amount is sent to the receiver.
