The era of massive change in technology

Why am i talking about ethereum?? 
What is there so different about it?
Bitcoin introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto aimed mostly on financial transactions which we had been doing since it came into existence. Vitalik, on the other hand, wanted to make use of blockchain for further applications as well, thats why he came up with the idea of Ethereum Blockchain which aims to provide a turing complete programming language that can focus on solving any computational problems. Nobody ever thought that a few lines of code with logic can have such power to change the functioning of different applications and thinking of different organisations. Smart Contract is the concept brought in here. 
This is not the first time that people talking about being digital or going on with virtual currency. Since 1998, people had been trying to follow an e-cash mode but the transactions would fail because of their rely on centralised body.
